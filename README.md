This repository contains 3 tasks that were completed successfully for the Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte.

## TASK 1
### IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. With the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species we can train a model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them accordingly with Machine Learning.

Dataset :
Iris dataset from Kaggle : DATASET

Project Steps :
Data Preprocessing : Load the Iris dataset and inspect its structure.
Data Analysis : Explore the dataset by visualizing the relationships between different features.
Data Splitting : Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training : Select multiple machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, train each model using the training data.
Model Evaluation : Evaluate the trained models using the testing data


## TASK 3
### CAR PRICE PREDICTION
Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. By considering these features we can train a model that can learn from the given data and make predictions accordingly with Machine Learning.

Dataset :
Car dataset from Kaggle : DATASET

Project Steps :
Data Preprocessing : Load the car dataset and inspect its structure.
Data Analysis : Explore the dataset by visualizing the relationships between different features.
Data Splitting : Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training : Select multiple machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, train each model using the training data.
Model Evaluation : Evaluate the trained models using the testing data.

## Task 4
### EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

Context
The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.

Content
The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.

This corpus has been collected from free or free for research sources at the Internet:

-> A collection of 425 SMS spam messages was manually extracted from the Grumbletext Web site. This is a UK forum in which cell phone users make public claims about SMS spam messages, most of them without reporting the very spam message received. The identification of the text of spam messages in the claims is a very hard and time-consuming task, and it involved carefully scanning hundreds of web pages.

-> A subset of 3,375 SMS randomly chosen ham messages of the NUS SMS Corpus (NSC), which is a dataset of about 10,000 legitimate messages collected for research at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. The messages largely originate from Singaporeans and mostly from students attending the University. These messages were collected from volunteers who were made aware that their contributions were going to be made publicly available. The NUS SMS Corpus is avalaible at: [Web Link].
-> A list of 450 SMS ham messages collected from Caroline Tag's PhD Thesis available at [Web Link].
-> Finally, we have incorporated the SMS Spam Corpus v.0.1 Big. It has 1,002 SMS ham messages and 322 spam messages and it is public available at: [Web Link]. This corpus has been used in the following academic researches:
